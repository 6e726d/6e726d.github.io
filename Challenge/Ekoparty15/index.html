<p>I know how it feels when a <em>CTF</em> or <em>Challenge</em> ends and you don't get the solution for a particular problem. So I decided to document how to solve the challenges I wrote for Ekoparty #15.<br></p>
<p>There were two challenges to solve for the Hardware Implant Challenge.</p>

<h3 id="first_challenge">1. First Challenge</h3>
<p>You can download the challenge file <a href="https://6e726d.github.io/Challenge/Ekoparty15/files/00.logicdata">here</a>.</br>So what type of file uses <em>logicdata</em> extension. After a quick search of the file extension on Google, we get results pointing us to <a href="https://www.saleae.com">Saleae</a>. We download the logic analyzer software from the Saleae web site and open the challenge file.</p>
<img src="files/00.png" />
<p>We have only one channel and it's named TX, so this could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a>.</p>
<img src="files/01.png" />
<p>We also have two annotations. If we zoom in at the first annotation.</p>
<img src="files/02.png" />
<p>Looks like a measurement for 1 bit, based on this measure we could get the baud rate(aka bit rate).</p>
<p>1000000 &#xF7; 8.66 = 115473.441109</p>
<p>This number is very close to 115200, a known baud rate. We can setup the bit rate in the <em>Async Serial</em> analyzer.</p>
<img src="files/03.png" />
<p>And we get the following:</p>
<img src="files/04.png" />
<p>But when we get to the second notation, the analyzer is not able to analyze the signal.</p>
<img src="files/05.png" />
<p>In the second anotation the measure is done is miliseconds instead of microseconds.</p>
<p><center>1000 &#xF7; 3.34431 = 299.015342477.</center></p>
<p>This number is very close to 300, apparently there were multiple baud rates in the same capture.</p>
<img src="files/06.png" />
&nbsp;</br>
<img src="files/07.png" />
And finally we get the flag.
<p><em>IMM{c1b82410259463fadbd84ddab4965b69}</em></p>
<h3 id="second_challenge">2. Second Challenge</h3>
<p>You can download the challenge file <a href="https://6e726d.github.io/Challenge/Ekoparty15/files/01.logicdata">here</a>. When we open this file we get the following:</p>
<img src="files/08.png" />
<p>We could try different analyzers in this case, based on the signals we can assume we have a SLAVE SELECT(aka CHIP SELECT) on channel 0 and a CLOCK signal on channel 3. So this looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface">SPI</a>. But if we use SPI analyzer we don't really get something useful. During the presentation we mention that SPI are use on Flash Memory IC and if we search the web for SPI, flash and salea keywords we end up finding a <a href="https://github.com/kasjer/saleae_spiflash">SPI Flash analyzer.</a></p>
<p>Once we build the SPI Flash analyzer and restart the Saleae logic analyzer tool we just need to setup the analyzer plugin configuration.</p>
<img src="files/09.png" />
<p>This will give us the flag.</p>
